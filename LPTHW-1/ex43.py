"""‚ÄùAliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating
    them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like
    a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve
    an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description
    when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map.
